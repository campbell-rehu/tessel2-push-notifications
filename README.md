# Tessel 2 Magnetometer 

## Introduction

This application sends push notifications from a Tessel 2 board using [Pushover](https://pushover.net). A notification is sent when a magnetometer circuit is broken. A potential real-world application is a sensor that detects whether a door is open or closed.
